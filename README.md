    <div class="tagline">JERX was born into a family where music always played an important role. From a young age, he was passionate about electronic music and constantly listened to tracks from various genres. Many instruments were present in his home, but his favorite instrument has always been the piano.

From childhood, music was a part of his daily life, but after reaching adulthood, he fully immersed himself in creating music. He began producing his own tracks, mainly within a specific genre, although he never shies away from experimenting.

JERX is entirely self-taught. As a child, he spent six years attending Georgian dance classes, which helped develop his sense of rhythm and musical vision. In addition to creating music, he is also actively involved in DJing, which brings him great joy.

Now, at 29 years old, JERX continues to experiment with music. His discography already includes around 70 tracks, including three albums and several EPs. In addition to his albums, he regularly releases standalone tracks, which bring great enjoyment to listeners.</div>
